## Kestrix coding task

Basic application for a simple user interface panel that enables a user to select their desired energy efficiency improvements and view important summary information for the selected improvement.

Summary information includes:
* Total cost of selected improvements
* Annual energy cost saving (having made those improvements and using the user's gas price)
* Payback period (assuming the gas price remains constant)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
